            <li>2 cups of chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of chopped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>Dried Basil</li>
            <li>6 Garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
            <li>1 Large Yellow Onion, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>3 Large carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2 into diagonal slices</li>
            <li>1 pound yukon gold potatoes, diced into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all purpose flower</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
            <li>2/3 cup frozen peas</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a large skillet and place over high heat. Add chicken pieces and generously season with salt and pepper, brown the meat so that you give the meat room for a nice sear. This should take about 5-6 minutes. You do not need to cook all the way through, we just want these nice and browned. Transfer to a large 6 or 8-quart slow cooker.</p></li>
            <li><p>Next add the following to the slow cooker with the chicken: chicken broth, dry white wine, worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, thyme, rosemary, dried basil and salt and pepper. Stir together with the chicken until combined, then add in garlic, onion chunks, carrots and diced potatoes. Cover and cook on low for 7-8 hours or on high for 4-5 hours. I prefer to cook this slow and low so that the chicken flavors really come out and the flavors have time to meld together, so 7-8 hours is really best for flavor here!</p></li>
            <li><p>Finally, remove 1/2 cup of chicken broth from the slow cooker and transfer to a medium bowl, then stir in ½ cup of milk and whisk in ¼ cup flour until there aren’t any lumps remaining. Add mixture back to the slow cooker and stir to combine. Stir in frozen peas and cook uncovered on HIGH for 15-20 more minutes until chicken stew thickens up a bit. Taste and season with more salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve immediately with fresh thyme, toasted french bread, cornbread, crackers, or even buttermilk biscuits. Serves 4.</p></li>
